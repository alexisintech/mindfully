        <span class="span-heading lg-font">The biggest value of journaling is that it cultivates discipline.</span>
        <p>Using Mindfully consistently will help your thoughts become less random and chaotic, and more organized and understandable.</p>
        <p>Mindfully serves as your safe space, without an audience, without judgement, so that you may release your thoughts and emotions and enhance your self-awareness.</p>
        <p>As you open an honest dialogue with yourself, you will learn how to process your emotions, control your reactions, appreciate your experiences, and become more conscicous of everything going on around you and <em>within you.</em></p>

          <p class="dark-card">Instead of trying to recall and write about what happened then, Mindfully encourages you to focus on today, and how you're feeling now.</p>
